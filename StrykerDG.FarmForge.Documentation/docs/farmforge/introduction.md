FarmForge is a farm management system that can integrate with IoT devices with 
minimal effort, and allows hobbyists, gardeners, and farmers to manage their 
gardens and farms by keeping track of crops and inventory. 

By connecting IoT devices, you can have access to central reporting, alerts, 
and more.

FarmForge is designed with the following goals in mind:

- It must be low cost so anyone can use it
- It must be configurable to meet a wide range of use cases
- It must be local-first so it functions well in rural areas with no or limited
internet
- Though being local-first, it must have the capability to connect to the web
and be able to expand or integrate with other systems
