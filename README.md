FarmForge is a farm management system that can integrate with IoT devices with 
minimal effort.

FarmForge allows hobbyists, gardeners, and farmers to manage their gardens and 
farms by keeping track of their crops and inventory. It also enables you to 
connect FarmForge IoT devices for reporting, alerts, and more.

It's designed to be low-cost and configurable in order to meet each individual's
specific needs. The Priority and emphasis is to have it installed and working
via the local network, but it can be reached everywhere through the use of a 
cloud provider such as Azure.

# Features
